# Imageboard

This application looks like Instagram where you can upload photos or images, see all previously uploaded pictures, 
write comments. It  was my first experience to write the application using Vue.js. 
So I was concentrated during the work to understand profoundly principals of Vue.js.

1. This is the homepage where you can see 10 previously uploaded pictures, fields to download  new image, add a title, a description of it, also possible to add a username.

2. Single image view where you can see all information about this picture, leave your comment, read previous comments.
